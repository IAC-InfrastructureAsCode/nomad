# Increasing Failure Tolerance with Spread

The Nomad scheduler uses a bin packing algorithm when making job placements on
nodes to optimize resource utilization and density of applications. Although
this feature ensures that cluster resources are being used efficiently, it does
not necessarily promote maximum failure tolerance of jobs across nodes.

The `spread` stanza solves this problem by allowing operators to distribute their workloads in a customized way based on [attributes][attributes] and/or [client metadata][client-metadata]. By implementing spread, Nomad operators can ensure maximum levels of failure tolerance based on their specific architectures.

## Reference Material

- [Scheduling][scheduling] with Nomad

## Estimated Time to Complete

20 minutes

## Challenge

Think of a scenario where a Nomad operator needs to increase the fault tolerance
of a job that is deployed across different datacenters (we will be using `dc1` and `dc2` in our example). We want to make sure that the workload is not too heavily distributed in either datacenter in case one of them goes down.

## Solution

Use the `spread` stanza in the Nomad [job specification][job-specification] to ensure the workload is being appropriately distributed between datacenters. The Nomad operator can use the `percent` option with a `target` to customize the spread.


## Prerequisites

To perform the tasks described in this guide, you need to have a Nomad
environment with Consul installed. You can use this
[repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/tree/master/terraform#provision-a-nomad-cluster-in-the-cloud)
to easily provision a sandbox environment. This guide will assume a cluster with
one server node and three client nodes.

-> **Please Note:** This guide is for demo purposes and is only using a single
server
node. In a production cluster, 3 or 5 server nodes are recommended.

## Steps

### Step 1: Place One of the Client Nodes in a Different Datacenter

We are going to customize the spread for our job placement between the datacenters our nodes are located in. Choose one of your client nodes and edit `/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl` to change its location to `dc2`. A snippet of an example configuration file is show below with the required change is shown below.

```shell
data_dir = "/opt/nomad/data"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
datacenter = "dc2"

# Enable the client
client {
  enabled = true
...
```
After making the change on your chosen client node, restart the Nomad service

```shell
$ sudo systemctl restart nomad
```

If everything worked correctly, you should be able to run the `nomad` [node status][node-status] command and see that one of your nodes is now in datacenter `dc2`.

```shell
$ nomad node status
ID        DC   Name              Class   Drain  Eligibility  Status
622dfefb  dc2  ip-172-31-20-105  <none>  false  eligible     ready
18de1c0c  dc1  ip-172-31-21-117  <none>  false  eligible     ready
abd5b2a8  dc1  ip-172-31-16-138  <none>  false  eligible     ready
```

### Step 2: Create a Job with the `spread` Stanza

Create a file with the name `redis.nomad` and place the following content in it:

```hcl
job "redis" {
 datacenters = ["dc1", "dc2"]
 type = "service"

 spread {
   attribute = "${node.datacenter}"
   weight = 100
   target "dc1" {
     percent = 80
   }
   target "dc2" {
     percent = 20
   }
 }

 group "cache1" {
   count = 5

   task "redis" {
     driver = "docker"

     config {
       image = "redis:latest"
       port_map {
         db = 6379
       }
     }

     resources {
       network {
         port "db" {}
       }
     }

     service {
       name = "redis-cache"
       port = "db"
       check {
         name     = "alive"
         type     = "tcp"
         interval = "10s"
         timeout  = "2s"
       }
     }
   }
 }
}
```
Note that we used the `spread` stanza and specified the [datacenter][attributes]
attribute while targeting `dc1` and `dc2` with the percent options. This will tell the Nomad scheduler to make an attempt to distribute 80% of the workload on `dc1` and 20% of the workload on `dc2`.

### Step 3: Register the Job `redis.nomad`

Run the Nomad job with the following command:

```shell
$ nomad run redis.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "01f212ee"
    Evaluation triggered by job "redis"
    Allocation "8f7ed89f" created: node "abd5b2a8", group "cache1"
    Allocation "ccfbe54c" created: node "622dfefb", group "cache1"
    Allocation "24d2cb08" created: node "abd5b2a8", group "cache1"
    Allocation "4a1415b7" created: node "18de1c0c", group "cache1"
    Allocation "62d14c6d" created: node "18de1c0c", group "cache1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "01f212ee" finished with status "complete"
```

Note that one of the five allocations have been placed on node `622dfefb`. This is the node we configured to be in datacenter `dc2`. The Nomad scheduler has
distributed 20% of the workload to `dc2` as we specified in the `spread` stanza.

Keep in mind that the Nomad scheduler still factors in other components into the overall scoring of nodes when making placements, so you should not expect the spread stanza to strictly implement your distribution preferences like a [constraint][constraint-stanza]. We will take a detailed look at the scoring in the next few steps.

### Step 4: Check the Status of the `redis` Job

At this point, we are going to check the status of our job and verify where our
allocations have been placed. Run the following command:

```shell
$ nomad status redis
```

You should see 5 instances of your job running in the `Summary` section of the
output as show below:

```shell
...
Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
cache1      0       0         5        0       0         0

Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created    Modified
24d2cb08  abd5b2a8  cache1      0        run      running  3m30s ago  3m29s ago
4a1415b7  18de1c0c  cache1      0        run      running  3m30s ago  3m29s ago
62d14c6d  18de1c0c  cache1      0        run      running  3m30s ago  3m29s ago
8f7ed89f  abd5b2a8  cache1      0        run      running  3m30s ago  3m29s ago
ccfbe54c  622dfefb  cache1      0        run      running  3m30s ago  3m30s ago
```

As stated earlier, you can cross-check this output with the results of the
`nomad node status` command to verify that 20% of your workload has
been placed on the node in `dc2` (in our case, that node is `622dfefb`).

### Step 5: Obtain Detailed Scoring Information on Job Placement

As stated earlier, the Nomad scheduler will not necessarily spread your
workload in the way you have specified in the `spread` stanza even if the
resources are available. This is because spread scoring is factored in with
other metrics as well before making a scheduling decision. In this step, we will
take a look at some of those other factors.

Using the output from the previous step, take any allocation that has been placed on a node and use the nomad [alloc status][alloc status] command with the [verbose][verbose] option to obtain detailed scoring information on it. In this example, we will use the allocation ID `4a1415b7` (your allocation IDs will be different).

```shell
$ nomad alloc status -verbose 4a1415b7
``` 
The resulting output will show the `Placement Metrics` section at the bottom.

```shell
...
Placement Metrics
Node                                  allocation-spread  binpack  job-anti-affinity  node-reschedule-penalty  node-affinity  final score
18de1c0c-c1b5-528d-c0e0-43da66d7df62  0.5                0.33     0                  0                        0              0.415
622dfefb-dceb-9c23-c292-7f8a2a3ca649  0                  0.33     0                  0                        0              0.33
abd5b2a8-31e8-6f90-41a7-f61d9738a5cc  0.5                0.515    -0.4               0                        0              0.205
```

Note that the results from the `allocation-spread`, `binpack`, `job-anti-affinity`, `node-reschedule-penalty`, and `node-affinity` columns are combined to produce the numbers listed in the `final score` column for each node. The Nomad scheduler uses the final score for each node in deciding where to make placements.

## Next Steps

Change the values of the `percent` options on your targets in the `spread` stanza and observe how the placement behavior along with the final score given to each node changes (use the `nomad alloc status` command as shown in the previous step).
